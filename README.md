# GitHubLab
This is a demo repository with supplemental lab exercises to learn about using Git and GitHub as part of a DevNet study group

## Git Basics

### Install Software
If you have not already done so, you will need to install and configure Git. Installation is not covered in these labs but both Git and GitHub desktop software can be found for your platform at: 

https://windows.github.com

https://mac.github.com

### Create an Account on GitHub

https://github.com/signup

### Configure local settings
This will configure your local user info for all local repos on your personal system. This is required for code collboration and use of GitHub. 

Set the name you want attached to your commits

`git config --global user.name "[Name]"`

Set your email address for use with your commits and GitHub transactions (should match your GitHub account)

`git config --global user.email "[Email Address]"`

(Optionally) Enable helpful colorization of CLI Output. 

`git config --global color.ui auto`
